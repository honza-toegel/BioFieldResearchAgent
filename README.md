# BioFieldResearchAgent

## Overview
**BioFieldResearchAgent** is an advanced research assistant designed to explore the bio-fields of trees and plants, particularly in interaction with humans. Built with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), this smart research agent autonomously plans and executes bio-field research, leveraging the latest insights from scientific literature and real-time sensor data.

Researcher can interact with the agent using natural language to define research goals, such as:
> *"Today we will be meditating close to oak trees between 10:00-10:30. The focus is to check if that has some impact on the tree bio-fields (electric and magnetic activity) compared with a control group."*

> *"Please investigate whether there is a circadian rhythm in the biofield of banana trees, focusing on the electric and magnetic fields in relation to daylight and astronomical time (position of the sun and moon)"*

> *"Today we cut the grass around the anon tree around 2-3 pm, is there any special activity recorded in the bio-field of the anon trees at this time? After 3 pm we moved to the banana trees, was this observable from the records taken?"*

The agent then formulates a comprehensive research plan, collects and processes relevant data using connected bio-field sensing devices, conducts analyses, and generates reports and communicates interactivelly with researchers.
